              Apache Commons Collections
                    Version 3.2.2
                    RELEASE NOTES


INTRODUCTION:

Commons collections is a project to develop and maintain collection classes
based on and inspired by the JDK collection framework.
This release is JDK1.3 compatible, and does not use JDK1.5 generics.

This v3.2.2 release is a bugfix release, fixing several bugs present in the previous
releases of the 3.2 branch. Additionally, this release provides a mitigation for a
known remote code exploitation via the standard java object serialization mechanism.
By default, de-serialization of "InvokerTransformer" instances is prohibited and
will result in an exception. For more details, please refer to COLLECTIONS-580.

All users are strongly encouraged to updated to this release.


Changes in this version include:

CHANGES
=======

o COLLECTIONS-580:  De-serialization of "InvokerTransformer" is disabled by default as this
                    can be exploited for remote code execution attacks. To re-enable the
                    feature the system property
                    "org.apache.commons.collections.invokertransformer.enableDeserialization"
                    needs to be set to "true". 

BUGFIXES
========

o COLLECTIONS-538:  "ExtendedProperties" will now use a privileged action to access the
                    "file.separator" system property. In case the class does not have
                    permission to read system properties, the "File#separator" field will
                    be used instead. Thanks to Trejkaz. 
o COLLECTIONS-447:  Tree traversal with a TreeListIterator will not be affected anymore by
                    the removal of an element directly after a call to previous(). Thanks to Jeffrey Barnes. 
o COLLECTIONS-444:  SetUniqueList.set(int, Object) now works correctly if the object to be inserted
                    is already placed at the given position. Thanks to Thomas Vahrst, John Vasileff. 
o COLLECTIONS-350:  Removed debug output in "MapUtils#getNumber(Map)". Thanks to Michael Akerman. 
o COLLECTIONS-335:  Fixed cache assignment for "TreeBidiMap#entrySet". Thanks to sebb. 
o COLLECTIONS-334:  Synchronized access to lock in "StaticBucketMap#size()". Thanks to sebb. 
o COLLECTIONS-307:  "SetUniqueList#subList()#contains(Object)" will now correctly check the subList
                    rather than the parent list. Thanks to Christian Semrau. 
o COLLECTIONS-304:  "SetUniqueList#set(int, Object)" will now correctly enforce the uniqueness constraint.
                    Thanks to Rafa? Figas,Bjorn Townsend. 
o COLLECTIONS-294:  "CaseInsensitiveMap" will now convert input strings to lower-case in a
                    locale-independent manner. Thanks to Benjamin Bentmann. 
o COLLECTIONS-266:  "MultiKey" will now be correctly serialized/de-serialized. Thanks to Joerg Schaible. 
o COLLECTIONS-261:  "Flat3Map#remove(Object)" will now return the correct value mapped to the removed key
                    if the size of the map is less or equal 3. Thanks to ori. 
o COLLECTIONS-249:  "SetUniqueList.addAll(int, Collection)" now correctly add the collection at the
                    provided index. Thanks to Joe Kelly. 
o COLLECTIONS-228:  "MultiValueMap#put(Object, Object)" and "MultiValueMap#putAll(Object, Collection)"
                    now correctly return if the map has changed by this operation. 
o COLLECTIONS-219:  "CollectionUtils#removeAll" wrongly called "ListUtils#retainAll". Thanks to Tom Leccese. 
o COLLECTIONS-217:  Calling "setValue(Object)" on any Entry returned by a "Flat3Map" will now
                    correctly set the value for the current entry. Thanks to Matt Bishop.
