              Apache Commons Collections
                     Version 4.0
                    RELEASE NOTES

INTRODUCTION:

Commons collections is a project to develop and maintain collection classes
based on and inspired by the JDK collection framework.
This version uses the generics features of Java 5 and is not compatible with
earlier JDK versions.

The process of generifying an API is complex.
For commons-collections, we have chosen to break the API in various ways.
The aim behind this is to provide an API design that better suits generics.
We have also removed all deprecated classes and fixed oddities in the previous
API that we couldn't fix due to backwards compatibility restrictions.

As such, this release can not be considered to be a simple, drop-in, replacement
for commons-collections. To help with the migration to this new version, the
package has changed to "org.apache.commons.collections4", thus it is possible
to have both commons-collections versions in the classpath.

These release notes will try to guide you in the process of upgrading, however you
should remember that this is a new API based on the original, so some concepts
have changed.

Major changes since 3.2.1
-------------------------

 - Use of generics for the API
 - Removed deprecated classes / methods and features which are now supported by the JDK
 - Replaced Buffer interface with java.util.Queue

   - PriorityBuffer: use either java.util.PriorityQueue or java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue

   - IdentityMap: use java.util.IdentityHashMap
   - ExtendedProperties: use commons-configuration
   - Synchronized[List,Set,SortedSet]: use java.util.Collections.synchronized*()

New methods in *Utils
---------------------

 o [COLLECTIONS-456] ListUtils#longestCommonSubsequence(...) to get the longest common subsequence of arbitrary lists or CharSequences.

   +COLLECTIONS-321] e.g. "truePredicate()" for class "TruePredicate". Thanks to Stephen Kestle.
 o [COLLECTIONS-240] "MultiValueMap" is now serializable. Thanks to Wouter de Vaal. 
 o [COLLECTIONS-231] Return concrete class in static factory methods instead of base class interface
                     (except for Unmodifiable decorators). Thanks to Torsten Curdt.

   +COLLECTIONS-253]
   +COLLECTIONS-273]
   +COLLECTIONS-282]     
 o [None           ] Switch Abstract*Decorator classes to expose decorated() protected method instead of the decorated collection directly.
                     Each class overrides decorated() to add its type covariantly, thus getList()/getSet() etc. methods are removed
 o [None           ] ArrayStack is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. It is replaced by the java.util.Deque
                     interface available from Java 6.
