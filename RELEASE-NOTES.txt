        Commons Collections Generics Package
                Version X.X
               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

Commons collections is a project to develop and maintain collection classes
based on and inspired by the JDK collection framework.
This version uses the generics features of JDK1.5 and is not compatible with
earlier JDK versions.

The process of generifying an API is complex.
For commons-collections, we have chosen to break the API in various ways.
The aim behind this is to provide an API design that better suits generics.
We have also removed all deprecated classes and fixed oddities in the previous
API that we couldn't fix due to backwards compatability restrictions.

As such, this release should not be considered to be a simple, drop-in, replacement
for commons-collections. You will probably receive compile errors, and you will
certainly have generification warnings to solve. These release notes will try
to guide you in the process of upgrading, however you should remember that this
is a new API based on the original, so some concepts have changed.
