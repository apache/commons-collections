  <release version="4.0" date="2013-11-27" description="
This is a major release: It combines bug fixes, new features and
changes to existing features.

Most notable changes are: use of generics and other language features introduced in Java 5 (varargs, Iterable),
removed deprecated classes / methods and features which are now supported by the JDK,
replaced Buffer interface with java.util.Queue,
added concept of split maps with respective interfaces Put / Get (see also package splitmap),
added new Trie interface together with an implementation of a Patricia Trie.

Because of the base package name change, this release can be used together
with earlier versions of Commons Collections.
The minimal version of the Java platform required to compile and use
Commons Collections is Java 5.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to this version as, in addition to new
features, this release includes numerous bug fixes.
  ">
    <action issue="COLLECTIONS-502" dev="tn" type="update">
      Resolved generic parameter inconsistency for various static fields, e.g. BagUtils.EMPTY_BAG,
      TruePredicate.INSTANCE and many others. All accessible static fields use raw types so that
      they can be used directly without explicit casting. To avoid compiler warnings about unchecked
      conversion and/or rawtypes use the corresponding factory methods, e.g. BagUtils.emptyBag(). 
    </action>
    <action issue="COLLECTIONS-501" dev="tn" type="update">
      Renamed methods "V MultiKeyMap#remove(Object, Object, ...)" to
      "V MultiKeyMap#removeMultiKey(Object, Object, ...)" to avoid future conflicts
      with a default method of the Map interface in Java 8.
    </action>
    <action issue="COLLECTIONS-500" dev="tn" type="update">
      Renamed "V MultiMap#remove(K, V)" to "boolean MultiMap#removeMapping(K, V)"
      to avoid future conflicts with a default method of the Map interface in Java 8.
    </action>
    <action issue="COLLECTIONS-499" dev="tn" type="update">

      "AbstractCollectionTest" by decorating the concrete Bag instance with
      a CollectionBag or CollectionSortedBag. 
    </action>
    <action issue="COLLECTIONS-498" dev="tn" type="fix">
      "CollectionBag" will now also respect the contract of the decorated bag in case
      a null argument is provided to either removeAll or retainAll.
    </action>
    <action issue="COLLECTIONS-497" dev="tn" type="add">
      Added bag decorator "CollectionSortedBag" which decorates a SortedBag to make it

      similar as all other unmodifiable decorators.
    </action>
    <action issue="COLLECTIONS-495" dev="tn" type="fix">
      "UnmodifiableTrie#unmodifiableTrie(Trie)" will not decorate again an already

      with other Unmodifiable decorators.

    <action issue="COLLECTIONS-481" dev="tn" type="fix" due-to="Hollis Waite">
      No collision detection/resolution was performed when calling "CompositeSet#addComposited(...)"
      with more than one Set as argument. Additionally use varargs parameters instead of arrays
      in CompositeSet and CompositeCollection constructor and addComposited method.
