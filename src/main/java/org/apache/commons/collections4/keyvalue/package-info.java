/**
 * This package contains implementations of collection and map related key/value classes.
 * These are usually used in maps, however they can be used as data holders in any collection.
 * <p>
 * The following key/value designs are included:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Map Entry - various map entry implementations
 *   <li>KeyValue - a key and value pair, without map entry semantics
 *   <li>MultiKey - a holder of multiple keys tied together
 * </ul>
