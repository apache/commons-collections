/**
 * A counting Bloom filter using an array to track counts for each enabled bit
 * index.
 *
 * <p>Any operation that results in negative counts or integer overflow of
 * counts will mark this filter as invalid. This transition is not reversible.
 * The operation is completed in full, no exception is raised and the state is
 * set to invalid. This allows the counts for the filter immediately prior to the
 * operation that created the invalid state to be recovered. See the documentation
 * in {@link #isValid()} for details.
 *
 * <p>All the operations in the filter assume the counts are currently valid,
 * for example cardinality or contains operations. Behaviour of an invalid
 * filter is undefined. It will no longer function identically to a standard
 * Bloom filter that is the merge of all the Bloom filters that have been added
 * to and not later subtracted from the counting Bloom filter.
 *
 * <p>The maximum supported number of items that can be stored in the filter is
 * limited by the maximum array size combined with the {@link Shape}. For
 * example an implementation using a {@link Shape} with a false-positive
 * probability of 1e-6 and {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} bits can reversibly store
 * approximately 75 million items using 20 hash functions per item with a memory
 * consumption of approximately 8 GB.

     * counts. If negative then a negative count or integer overflow has occurred on
     * one or more counts in the history of the filter and the state is invalid.
     *
     * <p>Maintenance of this state flag is branch-free for improved performance. It
     * eliminates a conditional check for a negative count during remove/subtract
     * operations and a conditional check for integer overflow during merge/add
     * operations.
     *
     * <p>Note: Integer overflow is unlikely in realistic usage scenarios. A count
     * that overflows indicates that the number of items in the filter exceeds the
     * maximum possible size (number of bits) of any Bloom filter constrained by
     * integer indices. At this point the filter is most likely full (all bits are
     * non-zero) and thus useless.
     *
     * <p>Negative counts are a concern if the filter is used incorrectly by
     * removing an item that was never added. It is expected that a user of a
     * counting Bloom filter will not perform this action as it is a mistake.
     * Enabling an explicit recovery path for negative or overflow counts is a major
     * performance burden not deemed necessary for the unlikely scenarios when an
     * invalid state is created. Maintenance of the state flag is a concession to
     * flag improper use that should not have a major performance impact.
