/**
 * The interface that describes a Bloom filter that associates a count with each
 * bit index to allow reversal of merge operations with remove operations.
 *
 * <p>A counting Bloom filter is expected to function identically to a standard
 * Bloom filter that is the merge of all the Bloom filters that have been added
 * to and not later subtracted from the counting Bloom filter. The functional
 * state of a CountingBloomFilter at the start and end of a series of merge and
 * subsequent remove operations of the same Bloom filters, irrespective of
 * remove order, is expected to be the same.
 *
 * <p>Removal of a filter that has not previously been merged results in an
 * invalid state where the counts no longer represent a sum of merged Bloom
 * filters. It is impossible to validate merge and remove exactly without
 * explicitly storing all filters. Consequently such an operation may go
 * undetected. The CountingBloomFilter maintains a state flag that is used as a
 * warning that an operation was performed that resulted in invalid counts and
 * thus an invalid state. For example this may occur if a count for an index was
 * set to negative following a remove operation.
 *
 * <p>Implementations should document the expected state of the filter after an
 * operation that generates invalid counts, and any potential recovery options.
 * An implementation may support a reversal of the operation to restore the
 * state to that prior to the operation. In the event that invalid counts are
 * adjusted to a valid range then it should be documented if there has been
 * irreversible information loss.
 *
 * <p>Implementations may choose to throw an exception during an operation that
 * generates invalid counts. Implementations should document the expected state
 * of the filter after such an operation. For example are the counts not updated,
 * partially updated or updated entirely before the exception is raised.
