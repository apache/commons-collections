/**
 * Implements Bloom filter classes and interfaces.
 *
 * <h2>Background</h2>
 *
 * <p>The Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that indicates where things are not. Conceptually it is a bit
 * vector or bit map. You create a Bloom filter by creating hashes and converting those to enabled bits in the map. Multiple
 * Bloom filters may be merged together into one Bloom filter. It is possible to test if a filter {@code B} has merged
 * into another filter {@code A} by verifying that {@code (A & B) == B}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Bloom filters are generally used where hash tables would be too large, or as a filter front end for longer processes.
 * For example most browsers have a Bloom filter that is built from all known bad URLs (ones that serve up malicious software).
 * When you enter a URL the browser builds a Bloom filter and checks to see if it is "in" the bad URL filter. If not the
 * URL is good, if it matches, then the expensive lookup on a remote system is made to see if it actually is in the
 * list. There are lots of other uses, and in most cases the reason is to perform a fast check as a gateway for a longer
 * operation.</p>
 *
 * <p>Some Bloom filters (e.g. {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.CountingBloomFilter}) use counters rather than bits. In this case each counter
 * is called a <em>cell</em>.</p>
 *
 * <h3>BloomFilter</h3>
 *
 * <p>The Bloom filter architecture here is designed for speed of execution, so some methods like {@code merge}, {@code remove},
 * {@code add}, and {@code subtract} may throw exceptions. Once an exception is thrown the state of the Bloom filter is unknown.
 * The choice to use not use atomic transactions was made to achieve maximum performance under correct usage.</p>
 *
 * <h4>Nomenclature</h4>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><em>bit map</em> - In the {@code bloomfilter} package a <em>bit map</em> is not a structure but a logical construct.  It is conceptualized
 *     as an ordered collection of {@code long} values each of which is interpreted as the enabled true/false state of 64 continuous indices.  The mapping of
 *     bits into the {@code long} values is described in the {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BitMaps} Javadoc.</li>
 *
 *     <li><em>index</em> - In the {@code bloomfilter} package an Index is a logical collection of {@code int}s specifying the enabled
 *     bits in the bit map.</li>
 *
 *     <li><em>cell</em> - Some Bloom filters (e.g. {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.CountingBloomFilter}) use counters rather than bits.  In the {@code bloomfilter} package
 *     Cells are pairs of ints representing an index and a value.  They are not the standard Java {@code Pair} objects,
 *     nor the Apache Commons Lang version either.</li>
 *
 *     <li><em>extractor</em> - The extractors are {@link java.lang.FunctionalInterface}s that are conceptually iterators on a bit map, an <em>index</em>, or a
 *     collection of <em>cells</em>, with an early termination switch.  Extractors have
 *     names like {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BitMapExtractor} or
 *     {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.IndexExtractor} and have a {@code processXs} methods that take a
 *     type specialization of {@link java.util.function.Predicate}.
 *     {@code Predicate} type argument.
 *     (e.g. {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BitMapExtractor#processBitMaps(java.util.function.LongPredicate)},
 *     {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.IndexExtractor#processIndices(java.util.function.IntPredicate)},
 *     and {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.CellExtractor#processCells(org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.CellExtractor.CellPredicate)}).
 *     The predicate is expected to process each of the Xs in turn and return {@code true} if the processing should continue
 *     or {@code false} to stop it. </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>There is an obvious association between the bit map and the Index, as defined above, in that if bit 5 is enabled in the
 * bit map than the Index must contain the value 5.</p>
 *
 *
 * <h4>Implementation Notes</h4>
 *
 * <p>The architecture is designed so that the implementation of the storage of bits is abstracted. Rather than specifying a
 * specific state representation we require that all Bloom filters implement the {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BitMapExtractor}
 * and {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.IndexExtractor} interfaces,
 * Counting-based Bloom filters implement {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.CellExtractor} as well.  There are static
 * methods in the various Extractor interfaces to convert from one type to another.</p>
 *
 * <p>Programs that utilize the Bloom filters may use the {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BitMapExtractor}
 * or {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.IndexExtractor} to retrieve
 * or process a representation of the internal structure.
 * Additional methods are available in the {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BitMaps} class to assist in
 * manipulation of bit map representations.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Bloom filter is an interface that requires implementation of 9 methods:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BloomFilter#cardinality()} returns the number of bits enabled in the Bloom filter.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BloomFilter#characteristics()} which returns an integer of characteristics flags.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BloomFilter#clear()} which resets the Bloom filter to its initial empty state.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BloomFilter#contains(IndexExtractor)} which returns true if the bits specified
 * by the indices generated by IndexExtractor are enabled in the Bloom filter.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BloomFilter#copy()} which returns a fresh copy of the bitmap.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BloomFilter#getShape()} which returns the shape the Bloom filter was created with.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BloomFilter#merge(BitMapExtractor)} which merges the BitMaps from the BitMapExtractor
 * into the internal representation of the Bloom filter.</li>
 *
 * <li>{@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.BloomFilter#merge(IndexExtractor)} which merges the indices from the IndexExtractor
 * into the internal representation of the Bloom filter.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Other methods should be implemented where they can be done so more efficiently than the default implementations.</p>
 *
 * <h3>CountingBloomFilter</h3>
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.CountingBloomFilter} extends the Bloom filter by counting the number
 * of times a specific bit has been
 * enabled or disabled. This allows the removal (opposite of merge) of Bloom filters at the expense of additional
 * overhead.</p>
 *
 * <h3>LayeredBloomFilter</h3>
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.LayeredBloomFilter} extends the Bloom filter by creating layers of Bloom
 * filters that can be queried as a single
 * Filter or as a set of filters. This adds the ability to perform windowing on streams of data.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Shape</h3>
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.Shape} describes the Bloom filter using the number of bits and the number
 * of hash functions.  It can be specified
 * by the number of expected items and desired false positive rate.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Hasher</h3>
 *
 * <p>A {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.Hasher} converts bytes into a series of integers based on a Shape.
 * Each hasher represents one item being added
 * to the Bloom filter.</p>
 *
 * <p>The {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.EnhancedDoubleHasher} uses a combinatorial generation technique to
 * create the integers. It is easily
 * initialized by using a byte array returned by the standard {@link java.security.MessageDigest} or other hash function to
 * initialize the Hasher. Alternatively, a pair of a long values may also be used.</p>
 *
 * <p>Other implementations of the {@link org.apache.commons.collections4.bloomfilter.Hasher} are easy to implement.</p>
