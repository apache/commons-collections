/**
 * A Hasher represents items of arbitrary byte size as a byte representation of
 * fixed size (a hash). The hash representations can be used to create indexes
 * for a Bloom filter.
 *
 * <p>The hash for each item is created using a hash function; use of different
 * seeds allows generation of different hashes for the same item. The hashes can
 * be dynamically converted into the bit index representation used by a Bloom
 * filter. The shape of the Bloom filter defines the number of indexes per item
 * and the range of the indexes. The hasher can generate the correct number of
 * indexes in the range required by the Bloom filter for each item it
 * represents.
 *
 * <p>Note that the process of generating hashes and mapping them to a Bloom
 * filter shape may create duplicate indexes. The hasher may generate fewer than
 * the required number of hash functions per item if duplicates have been
 * removed. Implementations of {@code iterator()} may return duplicate values
 * and may return values in a random order. See implementation javadoc notes as
 * to the guarantees provided by the specific implementation.
 *
 * <p>Hashers have an identity based on the hashing algorithm used.
