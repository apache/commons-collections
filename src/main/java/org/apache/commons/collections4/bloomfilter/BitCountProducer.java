/*
 * Defines a mapping of index to counts.
 *
 * <p>Note that a BitCountProducer may return duplicate indices and may be unordered.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must guarantee that:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The mapping of index to counts is the combined sum of counts at each index.
 * <li>For every unique value produced by the IndexProducer there will be at least one matching
 * index and count produced by the BitCountProducer.
 * <li>The BitCountProducer will not generate indices that are not output by the IndexProducer.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Note that implementations that do not output duplicate indices for BitCountProducer and
 * do for IndexProducer, or vice versa, are consistent if the distinct indices from each are
 * the same.
 *
 * <p>For example the mapping [(1,2),(2,3),(3,1)] can be output with many combinations including:
 * <pre>
 * [(1,2),(2,3),(3,1)]
 * [(1,1),(1,1),(2,1),(2,1),(2,1),(3,1)]
 * [(1,1),(3,1),(1,1),(2,1),(2,1),(2,1)]
 * [(3,1),(1,1),(2,2),(1,1),(2,1)]
 * ...
