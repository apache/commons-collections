<section name="Release notes for version 4.0">
<hr />
<p>
Commons collections is a project to develop and maintain collection classes based on and inspired
by the JDK collection framework.
This version uses the generics features of Java 5 and is not compatible with earlier JDK versions.
</p>
<p>
The process of generifying an API is complex.
For commons-collections, we have chosen to break the API in various ways.
The aim behind this is to provide an API design that better suits generics.
We have also removed all deprecated classes and fixed oddities in the previous
API that we couldn't fix due to backwards compatibility restrictions.
</p>
<p>
As such, this release can not be considered to be a simple, drop-in, replacement
for commons-collections. To help with the migration to this new version, the
package has changed to "org.apache.commons.collections4", thus it is possible
to have both commons-collections versions in the classpath.
</p>
<p>
These release notes will try to guide you in the process of upgrading, however you
should remember that this is a new API based on the original, so some concepts
have changed.
</p>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>
<ul>
 <li>Java 5 or later is required</li>
 <li>This release is <b>not</b> source or binary compatible with previous releases of
     Commons Collections. This includes releases from the 3.x branch as well as
     preceding alpha releases for 4.0 (see details of changes below)</li>
</ul>

<li>Replaced Buffer interface with java.util.Queue</li>
<li>Added concept of split maps with respective interfaces Put / Get (see also package splitmap)</li>
<li>Added new Trie interface together with an implementation of a Patricia Trie</li>
</ul>

<li>Added method "ListOrderedMap#putAll(int, Map)". Thanks to Vasily Ivanov.</li>
<li>Added support for resettable iterators in "IteratorIterable". Thanks to Dusan Chromy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed classes / methods</h3>
<ul>
<li>Resolved generic parameter inconsistency for various static fields, e.g. BagUtils.EMPTY_BAG,
    TruePredicate.INSTANCE and many others. All accessible static fields use raw types so that
    they can be used directly without explicit casting. To avoid compiler warnings about unchecked
    conversion and/or rawtypes use the corresponding factory methods, e.g. BagUtils.emptyBag().</li>
<li>Renamed methods "V MultiKeyMap#remove(Object, Object, ...)" to "V MultiKeyMap#removeMultiKey(Object, Object, ...)"
    to avoid future conflicts with a default method of the Map interface in Java 8.</li>
<li>Renamed "V MultiMap#remove(K, V)" to "boolean MultiMap#removeMapping(K, V)"
    to avoid future conflicts with a default method of the Map interface in Java 8.</li>
<li>Refactored the test framework for Bag implementations to extend from "AbstractCollectionTest" by decorating
    the concrete Bag instance with a CollectionBag or CollectionSortedBag.</li> 
<li>"UnmodifiableBoundedCollection" does now also implement the marker interface "Unmodifiable"
    similar as all other unmodifiable decorators.</li>
<li>"UnmodifiableTrie#unmodifiableTrie(Trie)" will not decorate again an already unmodifiable Trie.
    Also the return type has been changed to "Trie" to be consistent with other Unmodifiable decorators.</li>
<li>Moved "Equator" interface to base package for consistency.</li>
<li>Accept wildcard input where possible, e.g. in copy-constructors, Unmodifiable* decorators and iterators.</li>
<li>Narrow return type of "BidiMap#values()" to Set as the values are required to be unique.</li>
<li>Made field "collection" in class "AbstractCollectionDecorator" private and added setter "setCollection(Collection)" with scope protected to set the decorated collection during de-serialization.</li>
<li>Replaced "Collection" with "Iterable" for method arguments where applicable.</li>
<li>Changed "IteratorChain" to use internally a "Queue" instead of a "List". Iterators are removed from the queue once used and can be garbage collected after being exhausted. Additionally removed the methods "setIterator(Iterator)" and "getIterators()".</li>
<li>Removed method "setArray(Object)" in class ArrayIterator and method "setArray(Object[])" in class ObjectArrayIterator and made fields array, startIndex and endIndex final and package private.</li>
<li>Changed scope of various fields to private / package private where appropriate.</li>
<li>An iterator over a "Flat3Map#entrySet()" will now return independent Map.Entry objects that will not change anymore when the iterator progresses.</li>
<li>Several closure and transformer implementations in the functor package will now copy an array as input parameter to their constructor (e.g. ChainedClosure).</li>
<li>Change base package to "org.apache.commons.collections4".</li>
<li>The constructors for all *Utils classes are now private to prevent instantiation.</li>
<li>"CompositeSet" does not inherit from "CompositeCollection" anymore. The inner class "SetMutator" has been updated accordingly. Thanks to Michael Pradel.</li>
<li>Change maven coordinates to "org.apache.commons.commons-collections4". Thanks to Olivier Lamy.</li>
<li>Move the project structure to a standard maven layout. Thanks to Olivier Lamy.</li>
<li>TransformingComparator now supports different types for its input/output values.</li>
<li>"CollectionUtils#filter(Iterable, Predicate)" will now return whether the collection has been modified. Thanks to Jean-Noel Rouvignac.</li>
<li>"NOPClosure" is now a final class. Thanks to Goran Hacek.</li>
<li>Fields transformer and decorated in class "TransformingComparator" are now final. Thanks to sebb.</li>
<li>"SetUniqueList#subList()" will now return an unmodifiable list as changes to it may invalidate the parent list. Thanks to Christian Semrau, Thomas Vahrst.</li>
<li>Calling "CollectionUtils#sizeIsEmpty(null)" will now return true. Thanks to Benjamin Bentmann.</li>
<li>The predicate that rejected an object to be added to a "PredicatedCollection" is now contained in the respective exception message. Thanks to Chris Lewis.</li>
<li>"TreeBag" will now only accept "Comparable" objects as input when used with natural ordering. Thanks to David Saff.</li>
<li>The static factory methods have been renamed from "getInstance()" to a camel-case version of the class name, e.g. "truePredicate()" for class "TruePredicate". Thanks to Stephen Kestle.</li>
<li>"MultiValueMap" is now serializable. Thanks to Wouter de Vaal.</li>
<li>Return concrete class in static factory methods instead of base class interface (except for Unmodifiable decorators). Thanks to Torsten Curdt.</li>
<li>"CollectionUtils#size(Collection)" now returns 0 when called with null as input. Thanks to Stepan Koltsov,sebb.</li>
<li>"CollectionUtils#addAll(...)" methods now return if the collection has been changed by this operation. Thanks to Vasily Ivanov.</li>
<li>"CompositeCollection", "CompositeMap" and "CompositeSet" are now serializable. Thanks to Pal Denes.</li>
<li>The "CollectionUtils#select(Collection, Predicate, Collection)" method will now return the output collection.</li>
<li>"CollectionUtils#forAllDo(Collection, Closure)" now returns the provided closure. Thanks to Jim Cakalic.</li>
<li>Make generic versions of all classes in collections.</li>
<li>Switch Abstract*Decorator classes to expose decorated() protected method instead of the decorated collection directly. Each class overrides decorated() to add its type covariantly, thus getList()/getSet() etc. methods are removed</li>
<li>ArrayStack is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release. It is replaced by the java.util.Deque interface available from Java 6.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bugfixes</h3>
