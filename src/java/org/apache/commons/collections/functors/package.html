<p>
This package contains implementations of the
{@link org.apache.commons.collections.Closure Closure},
{@link org.apache.commons.collections.Predicate Predicate},
{@link org.apache.commons.collections.Transformer Transformer} and
{@link org.apache.commons.collections.Factory Factory} interfaces.
These provide simple callbacks for processing with collections.
</p>
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b> from v3.2.2 onwards this several classes in this package will
throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException} when trying to serialize or
de-serialize an instance to prevent potential remote code execution exploits.
</p>
<p>
Classes considered to be unsafe are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>CloneTransformer</li>
  <li>ForClosure</li>
  <li>InstantiateFactory</li>
  <li>InstantiateTransformer</li>
  <li>InvokerTransformer</li>
  <li>WhileClosure</li>
</ul>
<p>
In order to re-enable serialization support for these unsafe classes, the
following system property can be used (via -Dproperty=true):
<pre>
org.apache.commons.collections.enableUnsafeSerialization
</pre>
<p>
Be warned though that enabling serialization support for these unsafe classes
makes your application vulnerable to known exploits and you must ensure that
your application does not de-serialize objects from untrusted sources.
</p>
