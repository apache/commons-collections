<p>
This package contains implementations of the Buffer and PriorityQueue interfaces.
<p>
The following implementations are provided in the package:
<ul>
<li>BinaryHeap - implements both Buffer and PriorityQueue
<li>BoundedBuffer - implements a buffer with a fixed size that throws exceptions when full
<li>CircularBuffer - implements a buffer with a fixed size that discards oldest when full
<li>UnboundedBuffer - implements a buffer that grows in size if necessary
</ul>
<p>
The following decorators are provided in the package:
<ul>
<li>Synchronized - synchronizes method access for multi-threaded environments
<li>Unmodifiable - ensures the collection cannot be altered
<li>Predicated - ensures that only elements that are valid according to a predicate can be added
<li>Typed - ensures that only elements that are of a specific type can be added
<li>Transformed - transforms elements added to the buffer
<li>Blocking - blocks on get and remove until an element is available
</ul>
