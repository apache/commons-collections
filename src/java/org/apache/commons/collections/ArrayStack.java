/**
 * An implementation of the {@link java.util.Stack} API that is based on an
 * <code>ArrayList</code> instead of a <code>Vector</code>, so it is not
 * synchronized to protect against multi-threaded access.  The implementation
 * is therefore operates faster in environments where you do not need to
 * worry about multiple thread contention.
 * <p>
 * The removal order of an <code>ArrayStack</code> is based on insertion 
 * order: The most recently added element is removed first.  The iteration
 * order is <i>not</i> the same as the removal order.  The iterator returns
 * elements from the bottom up, whereas the {@link #remove()} method removes
 * them from the top down.
 * <p>
 * Unlike <code>Stack</code>, <code>ArrayStack</code> accepts null entries.
